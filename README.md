        <td>Push Button Counter - Embedded System</td>
        <td>To design a basic embedded system that counts the number of times a push button is pressed and displays the count output.</td>
        <td>This project demonstrates the fundamental concept of digital input processing in embedded systems. A push button is interfaced with a microcontroller, and each valid press increments a counter value. The output can be displayed using LEDs, Serial Monitor, or a display module.</td>
